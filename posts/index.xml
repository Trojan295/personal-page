We will leverage the DNS01 challenge and use a Route53 Hosted Zone to answer the challenge. The Cert Manager will use an EKS IAM Role Service Account, which follows AWS best practices for security.
Set up the EKS cluster with Terraform We will use this EKS module to provision our EKS cluster.</description></item><item><title>My simple The Elder Scrolls Online addon manager in Rust</title><link>/posts/20201228-eso-addon-manager/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/20201228-eso-addon-manager/</guid><description>I was missing a addon manager for ESO UI on Linux.

An example is Overwatch or Path of Exile.
What&amp;rsquo;s happening in the first minutes of the game is shader cache pre-compilation. It&amp;rsquo;s a process of compiling shader code into GPU instructions .The final cache code is dependent on the specific GPU you have, so this cannot be baked into the game files.</description></item><item><title>Gaming on Linux?

AWS Serverless Application Model is a framework to build and deploy serverless application on AWS using Lambda, API Gateway and DynamoDB.
Under the hood it is a AWS CloudFormation transform, which expands the CloudFormation syntax and adds additional resources under the AWS::Serverless namespace. During the template provisioning those resources get expanded to basic CloudFormation resources.</description></item></channel></rss>
