I was configuring recently Calico on a RKE2 cluster. I wanted to test the network performance of the CNI and check, if it can achieve the 100Gbps bandwidth of the NIC.

[iperf3](https://iperf.fr/) is a great tool for this, but unfortunately, it is single threaded and the test was CPU bound.

To overcome this I wrote a simple script, which runs multiple iperf3 tests on a Kubernetes cluster. The tool is available on [my Github](https://github.com/Trojan295/k8s-utils/tree/main/cmd/k8siperf3).

You have to provide the node for the iperf3 servers and clients and the number of parallel tests. The scripts then starts iperf3 servers, gets their pod IPs and starts a client for each server. At the end of the test it sums the bitrate of all the tests.

There results might be a bit off, as the client pods might not start and end at the same time. That's why the scripts discards the first and last 15 seconds of measurements.

When I compared the results from the script to the numbers in `nload vxlan.calico` they were pretty close.

```bash
‚ùØ go run ./cmd/k8siperf3 --parallel-count 8 \
	--client-node-name node-1 --server-node-name node-2
