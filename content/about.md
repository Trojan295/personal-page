I am a dedicated software engineer and open-source enthusiast focusing on cloud-native technologies. Currently, I help companies to create innovative and reliable software systems. I had the opportunity to work on development as well as operations side, and I'm able to quickly adapt to new roles and environments.

I am a [Certified Kubernetes Administrator](https://www.credly.com/badges/789c2578-082d-4edd-a73f-4b0f7c7e828e/linked_in?t=rja2ou) and [AWS Certified DevOps Engineer](https://www.credly.com/badges/1ec58343-177e-4afe-bb50-76d37749a6fe?source=linked_in_profile).
