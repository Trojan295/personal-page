I am a dedicated software engineer and open-source enthusiast focusing on cloud-native technologies.

I work as a software developer—mainly with Python and Go—and DevOps engineer.

Currently, I help companies to create reliable software systems in the cloud. I am an AWS-certified DevOps engineer and willing to contribute to DevOps consulting with Kubernetes and AWS and Golang programming projects.
