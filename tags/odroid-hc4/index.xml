The HC4 platform used on ARM64 processor and has two SATA 3, which can be used to plug HDD or SSD drive to it. At work, we are checking out currently the OpenEBS project, which allows to build a Container Attached Storage for Kubernetes using local disks. I was curious, if I could use OpenEBS on those HC4 devices and create a CAS for a Kubernetes home lab.</description></item></channel></rss>
