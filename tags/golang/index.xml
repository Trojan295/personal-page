I was sending domain events through RabbitMQ to run choreography-based sagas. One problem I had was ensuring that the domain event got sent out after modifying aggregates. It&amp;rsquo;s not possible to run an atomic transaction through MongoDB and RabbitMQ, so there can be a situation where the aggregate is modified successfully in the database, but we won&amp;rsquo;t send an event because RabbitMQ is not available.</description></item><item><title>Learning stuff: Pulumi for AWS</title><link>https://myhightech.org/posts/20210915-pulumi-check/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://myhightech.org/posts/20210915-pulumi-check/</guid><description>I decided to make a habit of learning at least one new tool, technology every month and prepare a blog post about it. In recent months I focused mostly on the stuff I was dealing at work. Right now I&amp;rsquo;m reading &amp;ldquo;Atomic Habits&amp;rdquo; by James Clear, so that&amp;rsquo;s the first habit I would like to create. :)
