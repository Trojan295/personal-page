      <description>In some shader heavy OpenGL and Vulkan games you can experience shuttering, when running the game for the first time. An example is Overwatch or Path of Exile.
What&amp;rsquo;s happening in the first minutes of the game is shader cache pre-compilation. It&amp;rsquo;s a process of compiling shader code into GPU instructions .The final cache code is dependent on the specific GPU you have, so this cannot be baked into the game files.</description>

      <description>Is gaming on Linux possible? tldr; Yes, it is! In many cases the user experience is like on Windows!
The biggest issue I had with switching completely to a Linux based OS were games. Game studios do not really care about Linux support, as the market share for this OS is around 2%. Moreover, OpenGL, the graphics library supported in Linux, is not developer friendly, so they did not want to use it.</description>
