We will leverage the DNS01 challenge and use a Route53 Hosted Zone to answer the challenge. The Cert Manager will use an EKS IAM Role Service Account, which follows AWS best practices for security.

AWS Serverless Application Model is a framework to build and deploy serverless application on AWS using Lambda, API Gateway and DynamoDB.
Under the hood it is a AWS CloudFormation transform, which expands the CloudFormation syntax and adds additional resources under the AWS::Serverless namespace. During the template provisioning those resources get expanded to basic CloudFormation resources.</description></item></channel></rss>
