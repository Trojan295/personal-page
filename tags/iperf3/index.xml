I wanted to test the network performance of the CNI and check, if it can achieve the 100Gbps bandwidth of the NIC.
iperf3 is a great tool for this, but unfortunately, it is single threaded and the test was CPU bound.
To overcome this, I wrote a simple script, which runs multiple iperf3 tests on a Kubernetes cluster. The tool is available on my Github.</description></item></channel></rss>
